The goal here is to explain the relationship between tensor networks and the Ising model.

The Ising model is really just a [Markov random field](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/representation/undirected/) with a 2D square lattice topology. It is therefore a classical probability distribution, on the Cartesian product of $L_xL_y$ boolean variables, where $L_x,L_y$ is the width (resp. height) of the lattice. The normalization constant (partition function) is given by:

$$
Z_{cl}(K_x, K_\tau) = \sum_s e^{\sum_i K_xs_is_{i+x} + K_\tau(s_is_{i+\tau} - 1)}
$$

where $s_i, s_{i+x}$ are horizontal neighbours and $s_i, s_{i+\tau}$ are vertical neighbours,  the sum is over all possible configurations of the boolean variables (spins, as physicists call them), and $K_x, K_\tau$ are parameters. $\beta$ is set to $1$. The $-1$ in the second term doesn't change the physics, but is convenient for the derivations below.

## The Ising model as a quantum system

As is often the case, we can also find a quantum system with Hamiltonian $H_q$ with a canonical partition function that is the same as the classical system we started with. Concretely, $Tr[(e^{- H_q})^{L_y}] = Tr[e^{- L_yH_q}] = Z_{cl}$, with:

$$
H_q(K_x,K_\tau) = -\sum_i b(K_\tau) \sigma_1(i) + K_x\sum_i \sigma_3(i)\sigma_3(i+1)
$$

where $\sigma_3(i) := I_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes I_{i-1} \otimes \sigma_3 \otimes \ldots I$, $K$ is a parameter, and $b(K) = \tanh^{-1}(e^{-2K})$. This is the **transverse Ising model**.

A state in the transverse Ising model lives in the Hilbert space $\bigotimes_i^N \mathbb{C}^2$. As you'd expect, the classical states of a single site $i$ are the eigenvalues of $\sigma_3(i)$.

!!! Note

    $b$ is an involution, and is related to the *Kramersâ€“Wannier* duality. Taking the simplest case of $K_\tau = K_x := K$, note that each choice of $K$ yields a transverse Ising model, which yields a classical Ising model, which is a distribution. So we can think of $K$ as the coordinates on a manifold of distributions. The duality is simply that $K$ and $b(K)$ denote the same distribution, or more precisely:

    $$
    \frac{Z(K)}{(\sinh 2K)^{\frac{N}{2}}} = \frac{Z(b(K))}{(\sinh 2b(K))^{\frac{N}{2}} }
    $$

    This can be seen by the fact that for the Hamiltonian, $-\sum_i b(K) \sigma_1(i) + K\sum_i \sigma_3(i)\sigma_3(i+1)$, $K \mapsto b(K)$ is the same as switching $\sigma_1(i)$ and $\sigma_3(i)\sigma_3(i+1)$, which is how the duality is usually presented. 


!!! Derivation

    We want to show that $Tr[e^{-L_y H_q}] = Z_{cl}$.

    Define:

    $$
    V_1 := \frac{e^{\sum_i^N b(K)\sigma_1(i)}}{\cosh^N b(K)} \\
    \quad \quad \quad \\
    V_3 := e^{\sum_i K\sigma_3(i)\sigma_3(i+1)}
    $$

    so that $e^{-H_q - C}=V_1V_3$ for some constant $C$.

    We then calculate $\langle s'|V_1V_3|s\rangle$ for two states $s, s'$ that are both eigenvectors of all $\sigma_3(i)$:



    $$
    \langle s' | V_1V_3 | s \rangle \\
    = \langle s' | V_1| s \rangle e^{\sum_i Ks_is_{i+1}} \\
    = \prod_i^N\langle s_i' | \frac{e^{\sigma_1(i)}}{\cosh b(K)}| s_i \rangle e^{\sum_i Ks_is_{i+1}}
    $$

    $$
    = \prod_i\langle s_i' | \frac{\cosh b(K) I + \sinh b(K)\sigma_1(i)}{\cosh b(K)}| s_i \rangle e^{\sum_i Ks_is_{i+1}}
    $$

    $$
    = \prod_i\langle s_i' | I + \tanh b(K)\sigma_1(i)| s_i \rangle e^{\sum_i Ks_is_{i+1}}
    $$

    $$
    = (\delta_{s_i, s'_i} + \delta_{s_i, -s'_i}e^{-2K})e^{\sum_i Ks_is_{i+1}}
    $$

    Observe that for $L_y=1$, $Tr[e^{-L_yH_q}]=\sum_{s,s'}\langle s' | V_1V_3 | s \rangle$, which is what we just calculated, and is evidently equal to the classical partition function $Z_{cl}$. The result extends to $L_y=n$ in an obvious way.



Graphically, we have $e^{-H_q}$:

## The Ising model as an MPO

The next observation is that $e^{-H_q}$ is actually an MPO, that is:

![Ising MPO](/img/ising_mpo.png)

This is easy to show. Recalling that $\exp(i\theta v\cdot \overrightarrow\sigma) = \cos(\theta)I + i\sin(\theta)v\cdot \overrightarrow \sigma$, observe that $e^{i\sum_j^N (-ib(K))\sigma_1(j)} = \prod_j  e^{i(-ib(K))\sigma_1(j)} = \prod_j(\cos(ib(K))I + \sin(ib(K))\sigma_1(j))$ which is just a tensor product of 2x2 matrices. Similarly, $e^{i\sum_j (-iK)\sigma_3(j)\sigma_3(i+1)} = \prod_j e^{i(-iK)\sigma_3(j)\sigma_3(i+1)} = \prod_j(\cos(-iK)I + i\sin(-iK)\sigma_3(j)\sigma_3(i+1))$, which is an MPO.

To calculate $Z_{cl}$, we then contract the MPO against itself repeatedly.

## Defects (Excitations)

One can then study variations to this tensor network, such as the effect of interposing a 1D tensor network in the middle of the Ising TN.

For physical reasons, these are called defects, and have an algebraic structure that has come up a lot in recent theoretical quantum condensed matter physics.

I believe they form a fusion category, isomorphic to the category of representations[^1] of some Lie group, maybe $SU(2) \times SU(2)$?

[^1]: That is, a category where the objects are irreducible representations (i.e. functors from a given group to the category of vector spaces) and the morphisms are natural transformations between these functors, which amount to linear maps satisfying an intertwining condition. This category has a monoidal product and a direct sum, both inherited from linear algebra. Rules for e.g. addition of angular momentum, which is about the direct sum decomposition of the monoidal product of irreps are, I think, the fusion rules of the category.
